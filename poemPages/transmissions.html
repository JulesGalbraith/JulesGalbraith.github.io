  <p id="poem1">
    We cannot withhold our faces any longer
     possibility rarefies and collapses
    our sensing invites a contagion borne through perceptible strands in expression
    the potential is a problem for the as-is, the solution one of transit and shivering
     mediation makes lack into potential, a phantasm of elsewhere
    removals and absences an ethics of away
    the body is never still or whole it is a creature of many bonds
